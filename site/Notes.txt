Lec 04 - HTML document structure:
Validate HTML here: https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
Browsers interpret HTML top to bottom.
1)Must start with <!DOCTYPE HTML>
	This is because browsers need to know whether its a HTML-standard compliant page or not. Non-compliant pages (wihtout this header) were rendered in 'Quirks mode'.

2) Next is the <html> tag, which contains the entire HTML document.
3) <head> tag contains items that describe the main content of the page and metadata e.g. what character encoding, page title, author's description etc
	a) Specify <meta> tag to contain chracter set encoding. It is a standalone tag, which means there is closing tag.
	b) Specify <title> tag. It is required. HTML is invalid without it.
4) <body> tag. All content that is visible to user.
